# Syncfonia
This project uses the FFT algorithm to analyze mp3 music files to find the timing of the beats in the song

The game generates buttons that appear with the beat of the song so that you can tap along to the rhythm

It's similar to other rhythm based games that already exist such as osu!, but my game allows you to play any song you want instead of preexisting beatmaps
